# Memory Audit

A repeatable, **strictly read-only** report on the health of `.agent-memory/`. It exists
because a manual audit measured a stale clone of the store and drew two phantom-gap
conclusions — this command always reads the live files, so its numbers are ground truth.

**Never write, edit, or repair anything here.** If the audit finds drift, it reports it and
names the skill that heals it (`memory-maintenance`, `wrap-up`, etc.) — it does not act.

## Step 0: Preconditions

If `.agent-memory/` does not exist → output "No memory system in this project. Run
`/agentic-os:init`." and stop.

## Step 1: Drift

Detect divergences between where data IS and where it SHOULD be:

1. **open-tasks root drift** — does `.agent-memory/open-tasks.json` exist at the ROOT?
   Canonical is `context/open-tasks.json` only. If the root copy exists → flag
   "open-tasks root drift — SessionEnd hook / memory-maintenance will merge it".
2. **patterns schema drift** — read `patterns/patterns.json`. Flag any entry that does NOT use
   the canonical fields (`description`/`recommendation`/`evidence`) — i.e. legacy
   `name`/`solution`/`source_errors` or `title`/`prevention`/`error_ids`. Name them by `id`.
3. **learnings.md vs learnings.json** — does `learnings.md` start with the
   "Auto-generated from learnings.json" header? If not → flag regeneration needed.
4. **project-context.md vs docs/** — note that project-context.md is a cache; if its content
   names things absent from `docs/` (deleted agents/skills), flag possible cache drift.

## Step 2: Staleness

Report age-based risks (the dimension the manual audit got wrong from old data):

1. **learnings layer rot** — for each entry in `learnings/learnings.json`: if `layer` is
   `short-term` AND `date` (or `last_relevant`) is older than 30 days → flag "promotion-due".
   Report the count and the **newest** `last_relevant` so the reader can see how fresh the
   store actually is (avoids the stale-clone trap).
2. **quality never initialized** — if `quality/quality-score.json` has `last_updated: null`
   while `iterations/iteration-log.md` has entries → flag "quality metrics never run".
3. **user.md stub** — if `identity/user.md` is still only the init stub (no real Preferences)
   → flag "user.md not growing — check wrap-up Step 6 candidate queue".
4. **soul candidates pending** — if `identity/soul-candidates.md` has open candidates → note
   "N soul candidates awaiting the [j/n] gate at next session start".

## Step 3: Provenance / Schema consistency

1. **patterns provenance** — for each pattern, confirm `evidence`, `source_projects`,
   `confidence`, `first_seen`/`last_seen` are present. Flag entries missing provenance.
2. **superseded integrity** — if any pattern/learning has `lifecycle: superseded`, confirm it
   carries `superseded_by`. Flag dangling supersessions.
3. **JSON validity** — for each JSON store, confirm it parses. Flag any that would need
   `.corrupt.bak` recovery (but do NOT perform the recovery here).
4. **global provenance (global-provenance-audit)** — only if `~/.claude-memory/global/`
   exists. This is read-only reporting of the 4.A invariants — it heals nothing:
   - Flag global entries missing `scope` / `valid_from` / `source_projects` / `lifecycle`
     (un-migrated → name the count; heals via `migrate-global-schema-4A.sh`).
   - Count `active` global entries with `|source_projects| < 2` → "promotion-gate violation"
     (should be `candidate`, not `active`).
   - Count entries with `confidence <= 0.3` AND `lifecycle != archived` older than 365d →
     "decay-due" (heals via `memory-maintenance` Step 4b).

## Step 3.5: Classify Every Finding (gap-taxonomy)

Label each finding from Steps 1–3 with exactly one gap class, so the reader knows WHERE
in the memory loop the problem sits (source: membrain Loop-8 harvest, Rosine 3 / T-17):

| Class | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `knowledge-gap` | the information was never captured anywhere |
| `capture-gap` | recognized during a session, but never written to a durable store |
| `index-gap` | stored, but invisible to the index (quarantine, adapter error, bad frontmatter) |
| `retrieval-gap` | indexed, but not findable (filter/ranking/mapping error) |
| `link-gap` | both entries exist, but the relation between them is missing |
| `usage-gap` | found, but ignored by the acting agent |
| `feedback-loop-gap` | problem recognized repeatedly, but no procedural change followed |

**Diagnosis rule before any verdict:** a zero-hit search after a late filter is NOT proof
that the record does not exist — check for an index-gap or retrieval-gap before declaring
a knowledge-gap. (This is the real-world L23 failure class: quarantined records looked
like missing knowledge.)

## Step 4: Report

Print a compact table. Example shape:

```
MEMORY AUDIT — {project} — {date} (read-only)

DRIFT
  open-tasks root:     {none | FOUND at root}
  patterns schema:     {all canonical | legacy: P003,...}
  learnings.md header: {ok | regenerate}

STALENESS
  learnings:           {n} entries · {m} promotion-due · newest last_relevant {date}
  quality metrics:     {initialized | never run}
  user.md:             {growing | still stub}
  soul candidates:     {n} pending gate

PROVENANCE
  patterns w/o evidence: {n}
  dangling supersessions: {n}
  JSON validity:         {all ok | corrupt: <file>}

GLOBAL (~/.claude-memory/global/ — omit block if absent)
  entries w/o provenance: {n} (un-migrated → migrate-global-schema-4A.sh)
  promotion-gate violations: {n} (active but |source_projects| < 2)
  decay-due:             {n} (conf<=0.3, not archived, >365d)

FINDINGS (one line per flagged item — GAP CLASS from Step 3.5)
  {finding}            | {GAP CLASS}        | heals via {skill}
  e.g. legacy P003     | index-gap          | heals via pattern-extractor normalization
  e.g. P7 no evidence  | link-gap           | heals via wrap-up backfill

VERDICT: {clean | N drift items, M staleness items — see above}
Heals via: {memory-maintenance | wrap-up | migrate-global-schema-4A.sh | none needed}
```

Keep it under 20 lines. Report only — never mutate. End by naming which skill heals any
flagged item, so the user can act deliberately.
